## What is SkyForce?

SkyForce is a team that develops projects on different fields, the main one being discord. We immediately depopulated thanks to an innovative and cutting-edge bot called SkyForce Unity.

Our plan is to help anyone make their community big, safe and welcoming. We are currently landed on Discord but soon we will expand everywhere with many projects.
